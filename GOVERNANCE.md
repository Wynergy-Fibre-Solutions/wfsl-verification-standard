\# WFSL Governance and Change Control



\## Purpose



This document defines how the WFSL Verification Standard and its associated documents are governed, versioned, and evolved.



Its purpose is to preserve trust through stability, clarity, and restraint.



---



\## 1. Normative authority



The following artefact is \*\*normative and authoritative\*\*:



\- \*\*WFSL Verification Standard v1\*\*



It is frozen and MUST NOT be modified.



Any change requires a new major version.



---



\## 2. Informative documents



The following documents are \*\*informative and non-normative\*\*:



\- WFSL Intent Runner v1

\- WFSL Evidence Attempt Records v1

\- WFSL Operational Model v1



They:

\- Explain usage and intent

\- Do not alter verification rules

\- May evolve independently



Changes to informative documents do not affect the frozen standard.



---



\## 3. Versioning rules



\- Normative changes → new major version (v2, v3, etc.)

\- Informative changes → new document version

\- Demo proofs are tied to the standard version they demonstrate



No document is silently modified.



---



\## 4. Freezing policy



Once a standard version is published and tagged:

\- It is immutable

\- It remains available indefinitely

\- Corrections require a successor version, not edits



This ensures historical reproducibility.



---



\## 5. Change process



All changes follow this process:



1\. Proposal (documented intent)

2\. Review (technical and scope)

3\. Publication (new version or document)

4\. Tagging (immutable reference)



Urgency never overrides correctness.



---



\## 6. Trust model



WFSL does not ask consumers to trust:

\- Platforms

\- Vendors

\- Environments

\- Operators



Trust is established solely through:

\- Deterministic evidence

\- Cryptographic verification

\- Reproducibility



---



\## 7. Stewardship



WFSL artefacts are stewarded with the intent that:

\- They outlive individual implementations

\- They remain verifiable years later

\- They can be independently reviewed



Longevity is a design requirement.



---



\## Status



This governance document applies to:

\- WFSL Verification Standard v1

\- Its published informative extensions
